### Exploratory Data Analysis in R
I took an updated version of the standard Diamonds dataset that comes with R and did an exploratory data analysis on it. The dataset has almost half a million diamonds, all with GIA certification. I found an interesting anomaly with carat size that might indicate fraud (it's the first graph of the three polished graphs at the end).

### Exploration of the Lahman Baseball dataset
I used pandas and a number of the Python graphing packages to explore some relationships in the Lahman Baseball dataset. I uncovered an anomaly in the birthdays of baseball players, but only later found out that it was due to the Little League cut-off of July 31.
